You need a _middleweight_ product for processing background jobs in C#? Yeah, I do too!

Background processing is a huge topic, and there are a ton of hacky and enterprise-grade solutions out there for getting it done. *This isn't one of those solutions.*

However, this is _a solution_. It might be _your solution_ if:

# You don't need something as robust as "Resque":http://github.com/defunkt/resque#readme
# You need something more robust than Jeff Attwood's "HTTP Cache background task hack":http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/easy-background-tasks-in-aspnet/
# You like things that are easy to use and taste like candy

*Tasty Jobs* is basically a multi-threaded FIFO(First In First Out) queue that executes job tasks for you. You get to define your jobs in an OO(Object Oriented) style and I take care of the rest. You can even do recurring jobs via configuration-based schedules!

Here is a complete job class for sending an email:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552786.js?file=tasty-libraries-jobs-01.cs"></script>

To enqueue a new instance of @SendEmailJob@:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552786.js?file=tasty-libraries-jobs-02.cs"></script>

h2(#configuration). Configuration

There are three things you might need to configure to run jobs: *global behavior*, *recurring schedules* and *the job store* (i.e., persistence layer, like SQL Server). Strictly speaking, no configuration is required. However, if you don't set a job store then it will default to @MemoryJobStore@, which is probably not what you want.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552786.js?file=tasty-libraries-jobs-03.cs"></script>

The configuration above sets the job store to @SqlServerJobStore@, which is one of 3 persistence layers that ship with *Tasty Libraries* (the other two are @MemoryJobStore@ and @PostgresJobStore@). The job runner's heartbeat is set to 10,000 ms (10s, which is the default if left un-configured), and the maximum number of parallel jobs is set to 25 (also the default).

Next, I create an hourly schedule and add a single job to it. @repeatHours@ is a @double@, so you can make schedules that repeat at intervals of less than one hour if necessary.

Note that the job store is pointed at the connection string I want to use via the generic @metadata@ collection. Both @SqlServerJobStore@ and @PostgresJobStore@ look in this collection for a key of @ConnectionStringName@ to initialize their connection string values.

To set up your database for use as a job store, run the appropriate setup script from "http://github.com/ChadBurggraf/tasty/tree/master/Source/Tasty/Jobs/Sql/":http://github.com/ChadBurggraf/tasty/tree/master/Source/Tasty/Jobs/Sql/.

h2(#deployment). Deployment

There are three ways to "deploy" a job runner to run your jobs: in the ASP.NET process (during development), from the console, or from a Windows service.

I do not recommend you deploy a job runner inside of the ASP.NET process on production, unless you have a pretty light job load. That said, to get yourself up and running quickly, just add the HTTP module to your configuration:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552786.js?file=tasty-libraries-jobs-04.xml"></script>

h3. From the console

This is where it gets pretty cool. @TastyConsole.exe@ includes a job runner. Point it at your application and it will bootstrap itself up and start carrying heavy stuff. More importantly, _it will watch for changes in your application, and gracefully recycle itself when something is updated_.

Fire it up: 

@TastyConsole.exe jobs -d PATH_TO_BIN -c PATH_TO_CONFIG -v -l@

@PATH_TO_BIN@ is the path to your website's or application's @bin@ directory, which must contain a copy of @Tasty.dll@, as well as any assemblies that define your jobs. @PATH_TO_CONFIG@ is the path to your @Web.config@ or application configuration file, which contains the configuration described above. The @-v@ switch enables logging to the console window, and the @-l@ switch enables logging to a file (which will be placed in your application's @bin@ directory).

<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function() { $('#fig1-image').fancybox({'titleShow':false}); });
</script>

Notice that I issued a _safe quit_ command, which caused the job runner to stop dequeueing jobs and shut itself down when it finished processing all of the currently running jobs.

h3. From a Windows service

Did I mention it gets *even cooler*? Extrapolating on running jobs from the console, we can use @TastyJobService.exe@ to spawn a job runner for _one or more_ applications on the server.

Install @TastyJobService.exe@ using @InstallUtil.exe@ (on my machine, it is located at C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727):

@InstallUtil.exe TastyJobService.exe@

Once it is installed, open up @TastyJobService.exe.config@ and add your application(s):

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552786.js?file=tasty-libraries-jobs-05.xml"></script>

Now just start the service, which will launch processes for each application you configure. If a process fails or something goes terribly wrong, an event will be logged to the Windows Event Log, and it will keep trying to re-launch the failed process indefinitely.

h2(#persistence). Persistence

The persistence layer is pluggable, so you can implement your own if necessary. For now, Tasty Libraries ships with the following job stores:

1. @MemoryJobStore@ - All job state is maintained in memory. This store is unbounded, and is intended primarily for testing and playground usage.
2. @SqlServerJobStore@ - Persistence to Microsoft SQL Server.
3. @PostgresJobStore@ - Persistence to PostgresSQL.

You're probably already wondering where your technology of choice is (ahem, MySQL or SQLLite). Yeah, I know. Send "me an email":mailto:chad.burggraf@gmail.com and I'd be happy to look into building it for you.

That said, building your own is pretty simple. You need to implement @IJobStore@ and @IJobStoreTransaction@. If you're doing something from scratch, I recommend extending @JobStore@. If you're building something that targets an RDBMS(Relational Database Management System), extend @SqlJobStore@. If you do implement something, send me a pull request!

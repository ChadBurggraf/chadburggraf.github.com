Did you move some pages around on your website? Do you want to ensure that a set of pages are served over SSL(Secure Sockets Layer)? Let me redirect it for you!

# Drop a copy of @Tasty.dll@ into your project.
# Add a couple of lines to your @Web.config@
# ???
# Redirect for fun and profit!

Basically, you just need to add the @HttpRedirectModule@ into your @<httpModules>@ configuration section, and then configure your regex-based redirect rules. The rules are evaluated in order, and the first rule to match is acted on.

Below is the *actual configuration for "Virtual Keychain":http://virtualkeychain.com:*

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552746.js?file=tasty-libraries-http-redirect-01.xml"></script>

As you can see, I'm cleanly accommodating legacy URLs by permanently redirecting them to their updated counterparts. And it *works on IIS6!* 

In the snippet above, you can see that all of my redirects are @Permanent@ (HTTP 301) redirects. You can also supply a value of @Temporary@ to get an HTTP 302 redirect.

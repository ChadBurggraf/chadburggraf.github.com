h1. Geocoding With Google

p(meta). Updated 26 Aug 2010

The task is simple: given an address, what is its latitude and longitude? Good thing the folks at Google are willing to tell us!

*Update:* While writing this up, I became aware of the release of Google's "Geocoding API V3":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/. According to their "deprecation policy":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html#section_4_4, the API this code is based on should be available for at least 3 years. I promise to update _Tasty Libraries_ to the new API *way before then.*

Drop a reference to @Tasty.dll@ into your project and include the @Tasty.Geocode@ namespace in your code file.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552707.js?file=tasty-libraries-geocode-01.cs"></script>

Pretty easy, eh? You can also add your API key to your configuration file and use one of the other overloads to @GeocodeRequest.Make()@:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/552707.js?file=tasty-libraries-geocode-02.xml"></script>

There are a ton of classes in the @Tasty.Geocode@ namespace, covering (I believe) the entire "Geocoding API V2":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/v2/index.html.

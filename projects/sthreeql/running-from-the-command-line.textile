Unfortunately, there's not really much to it. Surely not enough to _warrant an entire web page!_ Babies are crying somewhere...

Assuming you're "all configured":configuration.html (and that you did your configuration in @s3ql.exe.config@), start by just executing @s3ql.exe@.

<div class="figure no-border" id="fig1">
	<a id="fig1-image" href="/assets/content/sthreeql-help-console-full.png"><img alt="SThreeQL help console" title="Click to view full size" src="/assets/content/sthreeql-help-console.png"/></a>

	%Figure 1%. The SThreeQL console help menu. Access by running @s3ql.exe@ or @s3ql.exe --man@. Click the image to view the full-sized version.
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function() { $('#fig1-image').fancybox({'titleShow':false}); });
</script>

Great Scott! It tells you what to do!

Okay, now that we know we're not alone out here in the cold, let's run some backup and restore targets. In this contrived example, I'll backup the database @McTesterson@ to my S3 account, and then restore it again to the non-existent database @McTesterson_Test@.

<div class="figure no-border" id="fig2">
	<a id="fig2-image" href="/assets/content/sthreeql-backup-restore-console-full.png"><img alt="SThreeQL backup &amp; restore console" title="Click to view full size" src="/assets/content/sthreeql-backup-restore-console.png"/></a>

	%Figure 2%. Running backup and restore operations with SThreeQL. Click the image to view the full-sized version.
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function() { $('#fig2-image').fancybox({'titleShow':false}); });
</script>

There you go. Rock some backups. Restore something to a different catalog name. Have yourself a sandwich.

When you're finished licking mayo from your fingers, "install the service":installing-the-service.html and run everything automatically.

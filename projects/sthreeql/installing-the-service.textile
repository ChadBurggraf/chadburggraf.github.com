h1. Installing SThreeQL as a Windows Service

p(meta). Updated 12 Sep 2010

Assuming you're "all configured":configuration.html (and that you copied your configuration to @s3qlservice.exe.config@), and assuming you've verified that everything works by "running the command line":running-from-the-command-line.html, you can install and start the Windows service.

First, copy the SThreeQL binaries and configuration files to a permanent location (i.e., C:\Program Files\SThreeQL or similar). Now fire up a command line and execute the following:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/560218.js?file=sthreeql-install-the-service-01.bat"></script>

The above assumes that Windows is installed in the @C:\Windows@ directory, and SThreeQL has been copied to the @Program Files@ directory.

Open the Services manager (Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services) and locate SThreeQL. Right-click and select "Start". 

If you make a configuration change, you'll need to restart the service. If you want to uninstall SThreeQL, run the following from the command line:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/560218.js?file=sthreeql-install-the-service-02.bat"></script>

Once the service is uninstalled, you can simply delete the permanent directory you placed the SThreeQL binaries into.

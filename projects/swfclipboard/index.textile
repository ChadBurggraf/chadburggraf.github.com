h1(#top). JavaScript + ??? = Clipboard

Check out the following usage guides:

h2. What It Is

So, _JavaScript + ??? = Clipboard_? The answer: *Flash!* It's fun to loathe Flash, but sometimes it solves the problem you need solved. I needed a nice, clean way to provide *~1,000* clipboard targets on a page. You might only need to provide one. Either way, SWFClipboard has got your back.

h2. Why It's Awesome

You get a really simple interface for dealing with user's clipboards across all browsers. You can target any element on the page without any custom setup. There are no library dependencies.

I don't know about you, but those look like the ingredients for _awesome_ to me.

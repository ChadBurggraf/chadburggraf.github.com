h1. I'm Waiting For You, Localhost

p(meta). Updated 26 Aug 2010

%(drop-cap)Y% es, this site is a web developer's pun on _Waiting For Guffman_. Now that we have that out of the way...

h2. Software

All pages on this site are 100% statically served. I write everything in *Notepad.exe*, live, on the server.

The first part is true. Everything is actually built using the absurdly-easy-to-use "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll static site generator. The site's source is on "GitHub":http://github.com/ChadBurggraf/chadburggraf.github.com for your perusing pleasure.

h2. What's In A Name?

_Waiting for localhost_ is something every web developer (especially those using compiled languages) has spent significant bits of their lives doing. It's the new *"I'm compiling!":http://xkcd.com/303/* Credit for the name goes to the very good looking "Jason Sukut":http://www.myspace.com/thankyoudomo.

h1. I'm Waiting For You, Localhost

%(drop-cap)Y% es, this site is a web developer's pun on _Waiting For Guffman_. Now that we have that out of the way...

h2. Software

All pages on this site are 100% statically served. I write everything in *Notepad.exe*, live, on the server.

The first part is true. Everything is actually built using the absurdly-easy-to-use "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll static site generator. The site's source is on *GitHub* for your perusing pleasure: "http://github.com/chadburggraf/wfl":http://github.com/chadburggraf/wfl.

h2. What's In A Name?

_Waiting for localhost_ is something every web developer (especially those using compiled languages) has spent significant portions of their lives doing. It's the new *"I'm compiling!":http://xkcd.com/303/*. Credit for the name goes to the brilliant and very good looking "Jason Sukut":http://www.myspace.com/thankyoudomo.

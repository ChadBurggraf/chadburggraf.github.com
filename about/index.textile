h1. Hi. My name is Chad Burggraf. I live in Arizona.

!(frame right)/assets/images/chad-burggraf.jpg(Chad Burggraf is Rocking)! %(drop-cap)T% o be honest with you, I'm not completely sure why I have a website. It appears to be required as a technology-savvy 20-something. So here we are.

Moving right along, then. I have four primary interests:

# Working
# Reading
# Drinking
# Rocking

h2. Working

As in, _writing programs_.

Mostly, work involves me cradling my head in my hands in despair and exasperation. Sometimes, I come out alive and create something useful. I am vehemently *anti-rockstar* and *anti-clever*... possibly because I doubt I could ever actually personify either.

I've mostly worked with the very *un-hip* _.NET_ platform (sssh, I secretly kind of like it). I also like and use _JavaScript_, _Objective-C_, _ActionScript_, _C_, _SQL_, etc. etc. I have very little interest in technology for technology's sake, and am prone to dive into whatever is available to *get the damn job done*.

h2. Reading

I read a lot, but very slowly. Offline, I read every _"Great":http://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Adventures-Kavalier-Clay/dp/0312282990/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1282778214&sr=1-1 "American":http://www.amazon.com/East-Eden-John-Steinbeck/dp/0142000655/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1282778241&sr=1-1 "Novel":http://www.amazon.com/One-Hundred-Years-Solitude-P-S/dp/0060883286/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1282778315&sr=1-1_ I can get my hands on (you're right, those links don't all fit). Online, I read anything interesting on the topics of _technology_, _entrepreneurship_, _economics_ or _politics_.

I lurk voraciously on "Hacker News":http://news.ycombinator.com/.

h2. Drinking

Not so much in *quantity*, but *quality* drinking is an unmistakably important part of me. When you're in your late 20's and have never been particularly interested in sports or the outdoors, how else are you supposed to spend time with your friends? Plus, "good":http://www.fourpeaks.com/beers.asp "beer":http://www.firestonewalker.com/ is sent to us by angels.

h2. Rocking

It's all about getting in the _zone_. Rocking is a _state of mind_. Jack Black understands this. Actually, Jack White does as well.

h1. Hi. My name is Chad Burggraf. I live in Arizona.

p(meta). Updated 20 Sep 2010

!(frame right)/assets/images/chad-burggraf.jpg(Chad Burggraf is Rocking)! %(drop-cap)I% am 5'11", 155 lbs (thanks parents - you just had to hold out on that last gorgeous inch, didn't you?). I have hazel eyes and brown hair. I'm a Gemini. 

Wait. Right. You *definitely do not care.*

Good.

I was a child. Then I was not. I went to school. Then I got a job. I played in some bands and met some friends (even a few girls) along the way.

Ultimately, my favorite pastimes are reading and ruminating. Doesn't matter much about what. Good "television":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire, the "great":http://www.amazon.com/East-Eden-John-Steinbeck/dp/0142000655/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1285046090&sr=1-1 "American":http://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Adventures-Kavalier-Clay/dp/0312282990/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1285046123&sr=1-1 "novel":http://www.amazon.com/Middlesex-Novel-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0312427735/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1285046161&sr=1-1, "rock":http://www.wilcoworld.net/ and "roll":http://www.trailofdead.com/. You know the stuff.

So if you find yourself in the dusty southwest and want to grab a beer, shoot the shit, or make fun of the fact that I sometimes write software for Windows, "drop me a line":mailto:chad.burggraf@gmail.com.
